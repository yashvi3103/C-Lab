13.What are Operators?

Operators are symbols or keywords in programming that perform actions on values or variables. They allow you to manipulate and work with data in various ways.

Why Use Operators?

Operators are essential for performing calculations, making comparisons, and combining values. They enable your program to perform tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

Types of Operators:

There are several types of operators in programming. Here are a few explained in easy terms:

Arithmetic Operators: These perform basic mathematical operations.

+ Addition: Adds two values together.
- Subtraction: Subtracts the right value from the left value.
* Multiplication: Multiplies two values.
/ Division: Divides the left value by the right value.
% Modulus: Returns the remainder of division.
Comparison Operators: These compare two values and return a boolean result.

== Equal to: Checks if two values are equal.
!= Not equal to: Checks if two values are not equal.
< Less than: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
> Greater than: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
<= Less than or equal to: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
>= Greater than or equal to: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
Logical Operators: These combine boolean values.

&& Logical AND: Returns true if both values are true.
|| Logical OR: Returns true if at least one value is true.
! Logical NOT: Inverts the value, turning true into false and vice versa.
Assignment Operators: These assign values to variables.

= Assignment: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+= Addition assignment: Adds the right value to the left variable and updates the variable.
-= Subtraction assignment: Subtracts the right value from the left variable and updates the variable.
*= Multiplication assignment: Multiplies the left variable by the right value and updates the variable.
/= Division assignment: Divides the left variable by the right value and updates the variable.
Examples:


int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int sum = x + y; // Adds x and y
int difference = x - y; // Subtracts y from x
int product = x * y; // Multiplies x and y
int quotient = x / y; // Divides x by y
int remainder = x % y; // Gets the remainder of x divided by y

bool isTrue = (x == y); // Checks if x is equal to y
bool isGreater = (x > y); // Checks if x is greater than y

bool logicalResult = (isTrue && isGreater); // Combines boolean values using logical AND
Why Operators are Important:

Operators are the tools you use to perform various operations on data. They're fundamental for making calculations, comparing values, and controlling the flow of your program.
