23.What are Loops?

Loops are programming constructs that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They help automate repetitive tasks and make your program run more efficiently.

Why Use Loops?

Loops are essential for performing the same action or set of actions repeatedly without writing the same code over and over again. They save time and make your code more concise.

Types of Loops:

Here are two common types of loops explained in easy terms:

for Loop:

The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code.


for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to repeat
}
Example:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
while Loop:

The while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.


while (condition) {
    // Code to repeat
}
Example:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    while (count <= 5) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", count);
        count++;
    }

    return 0;
}
Why Loops are Important:

Loops help you perform repetitive tasks efficiently, which is a common scenario in programming. They allow you to iterate through data, process items in a list, and more.
