9.What is a Double?

A "double" is a data type used to store numbers with decimal points. It's called "double" because it provides more precision than the "float" data type, which is another type used for decimal numbers.

Why Use Doubles?

Doubles are used when you need to work with numbers that require a high level of accuracy, such as scientific calculations or financial computations. They can hold larger and more precise decimal values compared to floats.

Examples of Doubles:

Temperature in degrees Celsius: 27.5
Distance in meters: 10.25
Weight in kilograms: 68.75
Declaring and Using Doubles:

In programming, you declare a double variable to store decimal values. Here's how you do it in C:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double temperature; // Declare a double variable named 'temperature'
    temperature = 27.5; // Assign the value 27.5 to the 'temperature' variable

    double distance = 10.25; // Declare and assign the value 10.25 to the 'distance' variable

    double totalWeight = 68.75; // Declare and assign the value 68.75 to the 'totalWeight' variable
    
    printf("Temperature: %.2f\n", temperature); // Display the result
    printf("Distance: %.2f\n", distance); // Display another double value
    printf("Total weight: %.2f\n", totalWeight); // Display yet another double value

    return 0;
}
In this example, the %f in the printf() function is a placeholder for a floating-point (decimal) value, which is replaced by the value of the temperature, distance, and totalWeight variables.

Why Doubles are Important:

Doubles provide a way to handle decimal values accurately and with high precision. They are commonly used in scientific calculations, financial applications, and any situation where accuracy is crucial.
