14.What are Arithmetic Operators?

Arithmetic operators are symbols in programming that allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numbers.

Why Use Arithmetic Operators?

Arithmetic operators help you perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numerical values, which is essential for many computations in your programs.

Types of Arithmetic Operators:

Here are the common arithmetic operators explained in easy terms:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.


int sum = 5 + 3; // sum will be 8
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.


int difference = 10 - 4; // difference will be 6
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.


int product = 6 * 4; // product will be 24
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second. Note that division by zero is not allowed.


float quotient = 15.0 / 3.0; // quotient will be 5.0
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of division.


int remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder will be 1
Examples:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 3;

    int sum = x + y; // 10 + 3 = 13
    int difference = x - y; // 10 - 3 = 7
    int product = x * y; // 10 * 3 = 30
    int quotient = x / y; // 10 / 3 = 3 (integer division)
    int remainder = x % y; // 10 % 3 = 1

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %d\n", product);
    printf("Quotient: %d\n", quotient);
    printf("Remainder: %d\n", remainder);

    return 0;
}
In this example, the arithmetic operators are used to perform various calculations, and the results are displayed using the printf() function.

Why Arithmetic Operators are Important:

Arithmetic operators are crucial for performing basic mathematical operations in your code. They allow you to manipulate numerical values, which is fundamental for calculations and solving various problems.
