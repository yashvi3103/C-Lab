11.What is a Boolean?

A boolean is a data type that represents one of two possible values: true or false. Booleans are used for making decisions in programming and determining whether certain conditions are met.

Why Use Booleans?

Booleans are used to control the flow of your program. They allow you to create conditions and make choices based on whether a statement is true or false.

Examples of Booleans:

Is the door open? (true or false)
Is the user logged in? (true or false)
Did the user provide valid input? (true or false)
Declaring and Using Booleans:

In programming, you declare a boolean variable to store true or false values. Here's how you do it in C:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h> // Include the boolean library

int main() {
    bool isDoorOpen; // Declare a boolean variable named 'isDoorOpen'
    isDoorOpen = true; // Assign the value 'true' to the 'isDoorOpen' variable

    bool isLoggedIn = false; // Declare and assign the value 'false' to 'isLoggedIn'

    if (isDoorOpen) { // Check if the door is open
        printf("The door is open.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The door is closed.\n");
    }

    if (isLoggedIn) { // Check if the user is logged in
        printf("Welcome!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Please log in.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
In this example, the bool data type is used to declare boolean variables. The if statements use these boolean values to make decisions about what to print.

Why Booleans are Important:

Booleans are fundamental for creating conditions and controlling the behavior of your program. They're crucial for making choices and branching your code based on different situations.
