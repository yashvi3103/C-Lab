24.What is a for Loop?

A for loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It's like a controlled way of doing something repeatedly.

Why Use a for Loop?

You use a for loop when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a certain action. It's great for tasks that have a clear start, end, and a consistent step in between.

How Does a for Loop Work?

A for loop consists of three parts:

Initialization: Setting up a starting point.
Condition: Defining when to stop the loop.
Update: Changing the value for the next iteration.
Structure of a for Loop:


for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to repeat
}
Example in Easy Terms:

Suppose you want to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
In this example:

Initialization: int i = 1 sets the starting point.
Condition: i <= 5 defines when the loop should stop.
Update: i++ increments i after each iteration.
Why the for Loop is Important:

The for loop is a powerful tool for performing a task a specific number of times. It's efficient and keeps your code organized when you need to repeat an action with a clear pattern.
