26.What is a do-while Loop?

A do-while loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code at least once, and then continue repeating as long as a certain condition is true. It's like doing something and then checking if you want to do it again.

Why Use a do-while Loop?

You use a do-while loop when you want to ensure that a block of code runs at least once, regardless of the condition. After the first iteration, it checks the condition to decide if it should continue.

How Does a do-while Loop Work?

A do-while loop first executes the code block, and then checks the condition. If the condition is true, the loop continues; if it's false, the loop stops.

Structure of a do-while Loop:


do {
    // Code to repeat
} while (condition);
Example in Easy Terms:

Suppose you want to repeatedly ask a user for their age until they provide a valid age (greater than zero):


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;

    do {
        printf("Please enter your age: ");
        scanf("%d", &age);
    } while (age <= 0);

    printf("Thank you! Your age is %d\n", age);

    return 0;
}
In this example:

The code inside the do block asks the user for their age.
The while condition checks if the age is less than or equal to zero. If it's true, the loop continues; if it's false, the loop stops.
Why the do-while Loop is Important:

The do-while loop is useful when you want to ensure that a piece of code runs at least once, regardless of the condition. It's commonly used for input validation.
