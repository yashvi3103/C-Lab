28.What are Arrays?

Arrays are a way to store multiple values of the same type under a single name. They're like a bunch of containers lined up in a row, each holding a different piece of data.

Why Use Arrays?

Arrays are used when you want to group related data together. They help you organize and manage a collection of values more efficiently.

How Do Arrays Work?

Arrays have a fixed size and each value is assigned a unique index, starting from 0. You access values by using the index.

Example in Easy Terms:

Let's say you want to store the ages of three friends:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int ages[3]; // Create an array to hold three integers

    ages[0] = 25; // Assign values to specific positions
    ages[1] = 30;
    ages[2] = 22;

    printf("First friend's age: %d\n", ages[0]);
    printf("Second friend's age: %d\n", ages[1]);
    printf("Third friend's age: %d\n", ages[2]);

    return 0;
}

Why Arrays are Important:

Arrays allow you to efficiently manage and access a collection of related data. They're crucial for handling large sets of information in a structured way.
