8.What are Characters?

Characters are individual symbols, letters, or symbols that represent a single piece of information. They can be letters of the alphabet, digits, punctuation marks, or any other printable symbol.

Why Use Characters?

Characters are used to represent text in programming. They're essential for working with words, sentences, and any kind of textual information.

Examples of Characters:

Letter 'A'
Digit '5'
Punctuation mark '.'
Symbol '@'
Space ' '
Declaring and Using Characters:

In programming, you declare a character variable to store a single character value. Here's how you do it in C:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char firstInitial; // Declare a character variable named 'firstInitial'
    firstInitial = 'J'; // Assign the character 'J' to the 'firstInitial' variable

    char punctuation = '!'; // Declare and assign the character '!' to the 'punctuation' variable

    printf("My first initial is: %c\n", firstInitial); // Display the result
    printf("A punctuation mark: %c\n", punctuation); // Display another character

    return 0;
}
In this example, the %c in the printf() function is a placeholder for a character value, which is replaced by the value of the firstInitial and punctuation variables.

Why Characters are Important:

Characters are used to work with text and symbols in programming. They're used for everything from displaying messages to processing user input, reading files, and more.
