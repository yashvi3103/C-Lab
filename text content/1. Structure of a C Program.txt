1. Structure of a C Program:

A C program is organized into a collection of functions. Every C program must have a special function called main() which acts as the entry point. Here's the basic structure:


#include <stdio.h> // Include necessary libraries

int main() {
    // Your code goes here
    
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
2. Syntax Basics:

a. Statements: Statements are individual instructions in your program, each ending with a semicolon ;. For example:

int x; // Declaration statement
x = 5; // Assignment statement
printf("Hello!"); // Function call statement
b. Variables: Variables are used to store data. They must be declared with a type before use. For example:


int age; // Declare an integer variable named 'age'
float temperature = 98.6; // Declare and initialize a floating-point variable
char letter = 'A'; // Declare a character variable
c. Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. main() is a function, and you can create your own functions too. Here's a simple function:


int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
d. Comments: Comments provide explanations in your code and are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and end with */ for multi-line comments or use // for single-line comments:

/* This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines. */

// This is a single-line comment.
3. Control Flow:

a. Conditional Statements (if-else): Use if and else to make decisions based on conditions:


int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You can vote!");
} else {
    printf("You cannot vote yet.");
}
b. Loops: Loops allow you to repeat code. Common loop types are for and while:


for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}

int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
    count++;
}
4. Data Types:

C has various data types to represent different kinds of values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more.


int age = 25; // Integer
float price = 10.99; // Floating-point number
char grade = 'A'; // Character
Remember, practicing and experimenting with code is key to understanding and mastering these concepts. Don't be afraid to make mistakes â€“ that's how you learn and improve your programming skills!
