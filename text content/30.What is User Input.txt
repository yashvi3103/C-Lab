30.What is User Input?

User input is a way for your program to get information directly from the person using it. It's like having a conversation with your program and giving it instructions.

Why Use User Input?

User input allows your program to be interactive and respond to different situations based on what the user provides. It makes your program more flexible and adaptable.

How Does User Input Work?

Your program asks the user a question or prompts them for information, and the user provides the answer. The program then uses that answer to make decisions or perform tasks.

Example in Easy Terms:

Suppose you want to ask the user for their name and then greet them:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[20]; // Create an array to hold the name

    printf("What's your name? "); // Ask the user for their name
    scanf("%s", name); // Read the user's input

    printf("Hello, %s! Nice to meet you.\n", name);

    return 0;
}

Why User Input is Important:

User input makes your program dynamic and responsive. It lets users interact with your program and provide information, leading to more personalized and useful experiences.
