What is C?

C is a programming language that was developed in the 1970s. It's known for its simplicity and power, and it's used to create a wide variety of software, from operating systems to games to applications.

Why Learn C?

Learning C is a great way to get started with programming because it teaches you the fundamental concepts that apply to many other languages. Once you understand C, learning other languages becomes easier.

Basic Concepts:

Variables: In C, you can create variables to store data like numbers or text. For example, you can create a variable called age to store a person's age.

Data Types: Different types of data (like numbers, characters, and more) are represented using data types. Examples include int for integers, float for floating-point numbers, and char for characters.

Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. You can create your own functions or use pre-existing ones. For example, you could create a function to add two numbers together.

Control Flow: You can make decisions in your code using if statements. For example, you could write code that checks if a person is old enough to vote before allowing them to proceed.

Loops: Loops are used to repeat a block of code. The most common loop types are for loops and while loops. You might use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

Arrays: Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. For instance, you could use an array to store a list of temperatures.

Pointers: Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They're used for more advanced memory manipulation.

Hello World Example:

Here's a classic "Hello, World!" program in C to give you an idea of what the code looks like:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
