25.What is a while Loop?

A while loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It's like doing something repeatedly while a specific condition remains valid.

Why Use a while Loop?

You use a while loop when you want to keep performing a task as long as a particular condition holds true. It's great for situations where you don't know in advance how many times you'll need to repeat the action.

How Does a while Loop Work?

A while loop has a single condition that is checked before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues; if it's false, the loop stops.

Structure of a while Loop:


while (condition) {
    // Code to repeat
}
Example in Easy Terms:

Suppose you want to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1; // Initialization

    while (i <= 5) { // Condition
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++; // Update
    }

    return 0;
}
In this example:

Initialization: int i = 1 sets the starting point.
Condition: i <= 5 defines when the loop should continue.
Update: i++ increments i after each iteration.
Why the while Loop is Important:

The while loop is great for situations where you want to repeat an action while a certain condition remains true. It's useful when you don't know the exact number of repetitions in advance.
