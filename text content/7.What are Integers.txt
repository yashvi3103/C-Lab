7.What are Integers?

Integers are a type of data that represent whole numbers â€“ the numbers without any fractional or decimal part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

Why Use Integers?

Integers are used to represent quantities that are counted, like the number of apples, people's ages, or items in a list. They are essential for performing arithmetic operations and making decisions in your programs.

Examples of Integers:

Number of books on a shelf: 10
Temperature in degrees Celsius: -5
People in a room: 25
Student ID numbers: 202103
Declaring and Using Integers:

In programming, you declare an integer variable to store integer values. Here's how you do it in C:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int apples; // Declare an integer variable named 'apples'
    apples = 5; // Assign the value 5 to the 'apples' variable

    int bananas = 3; // Declare and assign the value 3 to the 'bananas' variable

    int totalFruit = apples + bananas; // Add the values of 'apples' and 'bananas'
    
    printf("Total fruit: %d\n", totalFruit); // Display the result

    return 0;
}

In this example, the %d in the printf() function is a placeholder for an integer value, which is replaced by the value of the totalFruit variable.

Why Integers are Important:

Integers are the building blocks of many calculations in programming. They're used for counting, indexing, looping, and making decisions. Understanding how to work with integers is a fundamental skill in programming!
